        "Hi I'm Biswajit Mishra curently living at Bangalore and working as a java spring-boot consultant for JP Morgan & Chase. I'm a java cloud programing enthusiast and a web-design fanatic. I work with a lot of different technologies ranging from traditional SQL system to microservices cluster. I tend to focus on being fluent on as much technologies and methodology as possible in order to build myself a proper toolbox. This toolbox allows me to find the right tool for the right needs. I am a pragmatic worker focusing on time to market while still giving proper attention to maintainability and refactoring.",
        "I am a big fan Hollywood movies and vegeterian dishes."
